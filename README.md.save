# triage-log-processor# 🛠️ System Log Triage & Assignment Tool (triage-log-processor.sh)

## Project Overview

This project is a Bash automation script designed for system administrators and DevOps teams to rapidly triage and categorize system log entries (`app_output.log`) into actionable assignments.

It uses a chain of standard Linux text processing tools (`grep` and `sed`) to filter relevant log messages and substitute severity keywords with assigned owner IDs (e.g., `ERROR → ERROR-mccoy`, `INFO → INFO-spock`).

This project demonstrates practical log analysis, pattern matching, and bulk text transformation in a professional Linux environment.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Targeted Triage:** Filters only relevant log entries using `grep`
- **Role Assignment:** Substitutes severity keywords with owner IDs
- **Case Insensitive:** Handles `info`, `Info`, `INFO`, etc.
- **Non-Destructive:** Preserves the original log file
- **Fast Execution:** Processes large log files in seconds

## 🔍 Case Study: The Problem & The Solution

### Background

During peak traffic events, application servers generate massive log files that include both critical failures and routine informational messages. The volume of noise makes manual log review slow and unreliable.

### The Problem

The team needed an automated way to:

- Isolate all severity levels
- Assign responsibility based on severity
- Produce an actionable list for incident response

### The Solution

The `triage-log-processor.sh` script uses `grep` to extract relevant log entries and `sed` to perform multiple case-insensitive substitution passes for each severity level (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `FAILURE`, `WARN`).

This transforms raw logs into a categorized assignment list in a single execution, reducing analysis time from hours to seconds.
